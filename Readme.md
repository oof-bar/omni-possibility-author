## Technology

We built this on top of [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), the static-site generator that belongs to the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) family. It was our first time using it, so we're still figuring things out‚Äîpoke around, and [tell us what we messed up](https://github.com/oof-bar/omni-possibility-author). Personally, still a bit confused about ‚Äúloaders‚Äù and static assets‚Äîthere‚Äôs surely a better way of storing the library of terms, right?

The text scrambling effect was adapted from a [pen](https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/mErPAK) by [Justin Windle](https://soulwire.co.uk).
